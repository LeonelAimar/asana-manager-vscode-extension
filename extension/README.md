# Asana Manager

Welcome to a kind of tiny manager for Asana. The idea of this extension is to simplify the workflow and improve your coding time between tasks, as you can get a little peek of each one without closing or minimizing VSCode.

## Features

* OAuth2 Authentication with Lambda non-server function. No need for Personal Tokens. Just easier.
* Search for uncompleted tasks.
* Search for today-uncompleted tasks.
* Pretty Sidebar made up with Vue. ( For now, only auth and task searching  )
* Full details of selected task, comming from sidebar or top command prompt.
* Search for all projects and taking you to the Asana's project page.
